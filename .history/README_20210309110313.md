# Question
##### 1. Why is there no change on pbix after the full file measurement is formatted?
**Answer:** Modify any measurement on pbix at will, for example, add a space, then enter, the temporary database created by pbix will be refreshed, and the previous formatting and modification actions will also be refreshed; you can also create a new one on pbix A metric or refresh any table (preferably a very small table)
